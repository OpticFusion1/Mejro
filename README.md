<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Mejro is a text-based RPG coded in Java. Players must traverse a coordinate-based map without dying to enemies or an empty stomach, searching for weapons and supplies at points of interest. Victory is achieved by reaching a pre-determined location alive.</p>

<h2>Tutorial</h2>

<h3>Commands</h3>

<p>Allowable commands are in [] brackets. Capitalization does not matter when entering commands.</p>
<p>General commands may be entered at any time except when in battle. They include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[INVENTORY] to list available weapons, ammo, and food.</li>
  <li>[MAP] to bring up the current location as well as points of interest.</li>
  <li>[STATS] to list health and rest levels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Day</h3>

<p>3 food is consumed and 15 rest (out of 100) is lost every day. Resting will replenish rest and health completely, but will take up the entirety of that day.</p>
<p>Travelling will change position 1 unit in the respective direction. Only 1 unit can be covered per day.</p>
<p>Reaching 0 food or 0 rest will result in death.</p>

<h3>Locations of Interest</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Police stations have a chance of containing weapons and ammo. Military bases serve the same function, but their chances are higher.</li>
  <li>Grocery stores contain random amounts of food.</li>
  <li>Enemy camps are guaranteed to have an enemy inside them.</li>
  <li>E7 is the end goal.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weapons and Enemies</h3>
<p>These can be broken down into five corresponding categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Melee weapons are weak but do not need reloading. Used by Mutants.</li>
  <li>Pistols serve as light firearms. 8 round mag. Used by Scouts.</li>
  <li>Shotguns are powerful but with a tiny 2 round mag. Used by Hunters.</li>
  <li>Assault rifles are excellent at continuous fire. 30 round mag. Used by Stormtroopers.</li>
  <li>Sniper rifles deal massive damage with a 5 round mag. Used by Snipers.</li>
</ul>
